What part of the learning activity was the hardest for you?
The hardest part for me was understanding how or why certain lines of code did what they did. I get that "public List<Job> _jobs = new List<Job>();" created a new list, but what do the parts of that code mean? Is the list named "Job" as seen in between < and >? Or is the list named "_jobs"? I'm thinking it is "_jobs" and that "<Job>" refers us to Job.cs. Which, by the way, begs another question. Is it a reference to Job.cs or the Job class? Does the file have to be named Job.cs, or can it be named something else and still work?
